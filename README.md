# MACD
The MACD model was written in Python on a Jupyter Notebook which uses ticker data from Yfinance. <br> <br> The model uses a 5 day average decision basis. It produces slighty over 50% accuracy as opposed to slighty under 50% accuracy for a 3 day average decision. <br> <br> Clearly, the model is not a fortune teller, no scalable model can do that. The idea that the model floats around 50% accuracy suggests traders to flip a fair coin rather than go through the trouble of using MACD for trading.
